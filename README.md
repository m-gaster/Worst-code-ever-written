# Worst-code-ever-written

First script I wrote. Solves a dynamic programming problem. 

Written to fulfill course requirements in graduate algorithms and data-structures course, UniBo.

Dear Mikhael,

the code you submitted is clearly the code produced by somebody who is
just learning how to program. It contains a lot of almost-repeated code
that could have been factorized and, morover, a lot of code that is
quite strange and should not be written that way.
